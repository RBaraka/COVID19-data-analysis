# COVID-19 Data Analysis

A comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 trends using Johns Hopkins CSSE data, examining global patterns, US state-level variations, and statistical correlations between case and death rates.

## Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 data to answer key questions about pandemic trends, per-capita impacts across countries and US states, and correlations between case and death rates.

## Key Findings
- Exponential growth patterns in US cases and deaths
- Significant state-level variations in per-capita impacts
- Strong positive correlation (RÂ² = X.XX) between case and death rates
- Identification of states that performed better/worse than predicted

## Data Sources
- Johns Hopkins CSSE COVID-19 Time Series Data
- Population lookup tables from the same repository

## Analysis Structure
1. Data import and cleaning
2. Transformation to tidy format
3. State and country-level aggregation
4. Visualization of trends and comparisons
5. Statistical modeling and correlation analysis
